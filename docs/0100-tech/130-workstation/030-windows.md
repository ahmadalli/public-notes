# Windows

## Installation

- To skip Microsoft account login, when you reach to the login step, press `Shift + F12` to open a command prompt, then run `start ms-cxh:localonly` and create a local account. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1jp5vln/an_alternative_to_bypass_microsoft_account/))
  - `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` used to work for me but it no longer works, even with the `Remove requirement for an online Microsoft account` option enabled in Rufus when creating the installation media.
