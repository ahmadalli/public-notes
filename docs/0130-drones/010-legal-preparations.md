# Legal Preparations

Flying drones and taking footage with them requires some legal preparations. Here I'm writing about the legal preparations that are needed in EU:

## Terminology

Consumer drones activities are regulated by the EASA under the [Open Category](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/drones-regulatory-framework-background/open-category-civil-drones) section. Take a look at the document to get familiar with the terminology, specially the following terms:
- A1 to A3 subcategories
- C0 to C4 drone classes

## References

- [Drones - National Aviation Authorities](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa): It's a collection of links to each country's local licensing process and geographical restrictions.
- [RDW Guide (For the Netherlands)](https://www.rdw.nl/en/drone/applying-for-a-pilot-licence-or-operator-number-for-a-drone)

## Flight License

The first step is to get a flight license. The [RDW Guide](https://www.rdw.nl/particulier/voertuigen/drone/het-vliegbewijs-en-het-exploitantnummer-van-een-drone/aanvragen) provides links to recognized training organizations that you can choose from. There are also free options available for A1/A3 license:

:::tip

Your flying license is accepted in all EU countries regardless of where you got it from. You can take a free course from [DAC (Luxembourg civil aviation authority)](https://dac.gouvernement.lu/en/drones/train-where-how.html) and get your A1/A3 license.

## Operator Registration

You need to register as a drone operator at the country of your residence. The [EASA](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones/naa) website links to the local registration process for each country.

## Adding a License to the Drone

You need to add your license number to the drone. Your operator license follows the format `something-3letters` (e.g. `1X2Y3Z-ABC`). The first part (removing the last 3 letters) must be printed and attached to the drone (e.g. via a sticker) and also added to the drone's configuration.

:::note

It's been stated in [RDW Guide](https://www.rdw.nl/en/drone/applying-for-a-pilot-licence-or-operator-number-for-a-drone) (in the `Next steps` section) and the EuroControl course content states that the last 3 letters are not needed to be added to the drone's configuration and  However, the [EASA FAQ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/the-agency/faqs/drones-uas) doesn't mention this and I'm a bit confused about it. Personally, I'll follow the RDW guide and keep the last 3 letters private.

## Final Remarks

The process is pretty straight forward and you can get your license in a few days. Here's my take on the most important points to keep in mind when you're flying a drone:

### Before Flying

- Make sure you're familiar with your drone and its capabilities and limitations.
- Check the weather conditions.
- Check the drone.
- Check the area.
- Ensure you're in the right geographical areas.

### While Flying

- Maintain VLOS (Visual Line of Sight) with the drone.
- Be aware of your surroundings.
- Give way to other aircrafts, preferably by landing.
- Do not fly over people or above 120m.
- Respect people's privacy. Get consent if capturing identifiable individuals.
  - People might be identifiable by their faces, location, or any other means.
