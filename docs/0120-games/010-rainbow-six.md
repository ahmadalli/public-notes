# Rainbow Six Siege

I like the strategic aspect of the game compared to other FPS games. I also like the fact that it's not a run and gun game. It's more about positioning, planning, and predicting your opponent's moves.

## Gear

- I'm not good at shooting high recoil weapons, so I prefer weapons with low recoil.
- I've been mostly playing solo, so I prefer operators that can be useful without relying on teammates.
  - I prefer operators that can gather intel and breach walls.

## Operators

Here are the operators I like to play.

### Fenrir

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ Secondary weapon can be used to open hatches and walls.
- ☑️ His gadget can block off a path, give intel and distract enemies.

### Brava

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ Secondary weapon can be used to open hatches and walls.
- ☑️ Her gadget can hack enemy gadgets and give intel and advantage by using their gadgets against them.

### Solis

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ She has impact grenades.

### Azami

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ She has impact grenades.
- ☑️ Her kiba barriers can be used in defense situations.

### Thorn

- ☑️ Primary weapon is good enough
- ☑️ Her gadget sometimes surprises and damages enemies

### Osa

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ Her gadget is good for pushing

### Aruni

- ☑️ She can break walls with melee

### Zero

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ Has hard breach gadget
- ☑️ Can gather intel with his cameras

### Oryx

- ☑️ Primary weapon
- ☑️ Secondary weapon can be used to open hatches and walls
- ☑️ He can break walls and jump through hatches

## Casual Play

When I play casual, I peak the season's operator and for the opposite side, to challenge myself a bit more, I randomly pick an operator and I'll keep playing with that operator until I get a kill and out team wins the round.

This approach is more challenging for support operators like Clash but it's fun nonetheless.

## Generic Strategies

### Offense

- At least one hard breacher.
- At least one soft breacher.
- Gather intel at all stages of the game. It's rarely a good idea to rush in blindly.
- If you're carrying the defuser, don't rush in and stick with your team.

### Defense

- At least player should be able to make rotation.
- At least one player roam and reinforce hatches.
- Reinforce hatches and walls that are not part of the rotation.
- If there's a wall facing outside, it should be electrified.
- If there's Mira in the team, coordinate with her before reinforcing walls.
- There should be a balance between anchors and roamers.
