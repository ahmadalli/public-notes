## Personal Throwaway Email Addresses

For short term email addresses, I use `10 minute mail` services. I usually just search for it and use the first one that comes up.

For longer term email addresses, there are some privacy focused forward email services (that you can find using the same keyword). I use CloudFlare's email forwarding service using a cheap domain I bought for this purpose.
