# Buying a Car

:::note

**I only bought one car**, which is a 10-year-old Toyota. What I'm writing here is based on what I experienced and what I learned while searching online. Some of the points are just my hunches and I don't have solid evidence for them, so I marked them with `[Hunch]`.

## What to Check

### Car History Report

:::info

[Hunch] It is a big red flag for me if the car seller doesn't share the car's license plate number in their listing, making it harder to find more information about the car. You might be able to get the license plate number from the seller by asking them.

:::

As I bought my car in the Netherlands, these resources are mostly local to the Netherlands' market. Some of these services also give a free overview report that you can combine to find red flags about the car:

First check [RDW License Plate Check](https://ovi.rdw.nl/). This is the official source for the car's information in the Netherlands, and it's free. You can find some useful information about the car from RDW. I recommend going over the report and checking all the sections. Here are some of the parts I found useful:

- Number of owners (both private and commercial) **in the past 9 years**. For older cars, other (usually paid) reports are more reliable.
- Whether the car has been imported or not, by checking whether `Datum eerste toelating` (Date of first admission) and `Datum eerste tenaamstelling in Nederland` (Date of first registration in the Netherlands) match.
- `Tellerstanden` (Odometer reading) only gives a vague answer like "logical", but it's the same data that some other paid reports also provide.

#### Sources

Check the following services, which are usually paid but sometimes provide a free overview report that can still be useful:

- [Carfax](https://www.carfax.nl/en/): For imported cars, I would definitely get a Carfax report because other services mostly use local sources for their reports.
- [kentekencheck](https://www.kentekencheck.nl): The report is relatively cheap and gives you some useful information about the car.
- [CarScanner](https://www.carscanner.nl/): I only used its free report.

#### What to Look for

- Advertisement history of the car can give you some idea of how long the car has been on the market and, if it's been on the market for a long time, you can look into why it hasn't been sold.
- A more detailed APK history and APK recommendations give you an idea of the car's condition and the state of its maintenance.
- Odometer reading history gives you an idea whether the car has been driven regularly or has been sitting idle for an extended time.
- Ownership history can hint at potential problems if an owner sold the car after a short period of time.
- [Hunch] Business cars (that might be leased cars) have a good maintenance history but are not necessarily well looked after, especially for the car interior, since the owner may not have the incentive to keep it in good condition (apart from the exterior).

### Maintenance History

Check the car's maintenance history in its maintenance booklet.

:::info

Some sellers share the car's maintenance history in their listing, which is a good sign. Sometimes the maintenance history can be found on the seller's website, but not on aggregator sites.

:::

- Make sure the car is maintained according to the owner's manual, **at least once a year**.
- [Hunch] I trust the car better if it has been maintained by a reputable garage, preferably by an authorized dealer.
  - For Toyota hybrids, if the car has been maintained by an authorized dealer, the battery will be covered by an extended warranty.
- [Hunch] Take note of the mileage difference between services. A balanced maintenance history is a good sign that the car has been used regularly. If the car has been sitting idle for an extended time, some parts may have degraded.
- It would be ideal if you could see the detailed maintenance history, as it gives you a better idea of the car's condition, but it's not always possible.

### Test Drive

- Before testing your candidate car, test-drive multiple cars of the same model, same year (or close), and similar mileage to see how the car drives and feels, then compare them with your candidate car:
  - Handling and Steering
  - Acceleration
  - Engine sound in different RPMs
  - Braking
  - Noise at highway speeds
  - Suspension feel and noise, especially over road bumps
  - Interior Wear and Tear
- **Interior**: Wear and tear compared to other test drives.
- **Air conditioner**: Put the air conditioner on full blast and see if it cools the car down quickly and heats up quickly.
- **Exterior**
  - Any sign of rust or paint damage.
  - Scratches or dents
  - Any misalignments between different parts of the exterior. They might be a sign of an accident or repair work that may not have been reported in the history reports.
  - Different shades of paint might be a sign of a repair job.

### Red Flags

These might make it harder for you to resell the car in the future, or might require some extra maintenance costs:

- Accidents
- Noticeable exterior damage
- Improper maintenance
- Sitting idle for an extended time
- Servicing at unknown garages

### Seller

- **Authorized Dealer**: [Hunch] An authorized dealer, especially if you're buying a car with some sort of maintenance-upon-delivery package, has access to authorized maintenance tools (e.g. a battery health check). Since they're guaranteeing the maintenance, it's less likely for them to sell a car with a hidden issue.
- **Price of BOVAG or their own warranty**: If the price doesn't match the market price, it might be a sign of unfair pricing or anti-consumer business practices.

### Final Check Before Buying

- **Keys**: It might be obvious, but the car must have two keys.
- **Accessories**: Make sure the car has all the accessories it should have. The car I bought didn't have the cover for the luggage compartment, and initially the dealer claimed it was an optional accessory. I had to go through some back-and-forth to prove it was a mandatory accessory; they then contacted the previous owner and got it back.
- **BOVAG Guarantee**: [Hunch] I would feel more confident buying a car with a BOVAG guarantee, as I can get the car repaired if I encounter an issue that I couldn't find when checking the car.
