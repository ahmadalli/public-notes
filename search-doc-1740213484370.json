Orient comes from the problem we've defined for the component and observe comes from facts about the context and the environment of the component.  At this stage, it's important to not get into the details of the writing. The goal is to create a high-level outline of the writing so each part should not be more than one or two sentences.

We can use the following tools to structure the writing:  HeadingsListsTablesIconsDiagramsCode blocksSide panels  If a paragraph can be replaced with or shorten by one of these tools, it's a good idea to do so because these structures are the first things that get the audience's attention and they convey the message much faster than a wall of text.

It's ok not to write anything and spend more time on finding the problem. So, we can just spend more time on finding the problem.  Fear of failure​  Fear of failure is a common blocker to writing. We can start by intentionally writing a poor version to overcome this block.  It'll have two benefits:  The writing would not be as bad as it was imagined.We have something to iterate on, we can edit, rewrite, and improve it.  Hard to start​  When it's hard to start, it's a good idea to start anywhere it's easier to start with. We can start with the ending, middle, or even the middle of a sentence.

You can find your niche from the following sources:  Things you enjoy doing in your daily lifeThings you're curious aboutThings you're good atProblems that you want to solve either for yourself or othersikigai or similar books  Everyone has their own weight for each of the items above. While someone cares deeply about solving world problems, someone else is mostly driven by their curiosity. So, you need to find your own balance and don't worry if your answer is not the same as others.  The problem we're trying to solve in this stage is to identify what motivates you (aside from money) to do and enjoy the work that you're going to do.  Personally, setting long term goals doesn't work on me. By that I mean I wouldn't be motivated if I set a goal like &quot;In 5 years I want to become X/Y/Z or have X/Y/Z&quot;. So, after a long time of struggle and fighting against the common belief that &quot;In order to be successful, you need to have a long term goal&quot;, and after reading Consider Not Setting Goals in 2013 (I highly recommend reading this), I switched to defining areas of focus for myself instead. This switch was not something that happened overnight, but it was a gradual process that had taken a few years.  Therefore, the first step is to list down the areas that motivate you.  note This is not a one time thing. We change and evolve and learn about ourselves over time. There's no definitive answer to this question. The list is constantly changing and evolving. We're not looking for final answers. We're looking for some starting points. So, don't put too much time and effort into this. Take a few hours, write down your thoughts and move on.

Now that you have a list of areas that motivate you, we need to find jobs that match these areas, if you don't already know them. As I didn't have this problem, I can only hypothesize about the solution and I would start with the following if I wanted to solve it and would iterate from there:  Look for social media groups and forums that are active in these areas.Look for and ask people in your network that are active in these areas or might know someone who is.Look for events and meetups that are active in these areas. Check out the material and speak to the people at these events.Look for companies and people that are active in the areas that you're interested in.

Compared to my experience in Iran, the healthcare system in the Netherlands is a bit different. Back in Iran, I was privileged to live in Tehran and had easy access to a wide range of specialists and labs. I could visit a specialist without a referral from my GP and I could visit any lab that I wanted to. I could also visit a hospital's emergency room without a referral from my GP.  This system is not sustainable and equal and from the governance point of view, I understand that the Dutch government is trying to make the system more efficient, sustainable and equal and this requires more gate keeping and is more restrictive. And from the patient's point of view, it needs some getting used to.  I don't have knowledge about the performance of the healthcare system in the Netherlands compared to other countries so I can't say how much successful the government has been in making this possible.  Efficiency and sustainability comes with the cost of inconvenience on the patient side as the system might not be willing to ease up milder pains and symptoms. Back in Iran doctors tend to prescribe medicine for milder pains and symptoms. But here, they system's philosophy is to let your body do its job and only intervene when it's really necessary.  This philosophy also has the perk of being more cost effective. Nevertheless, Every system makes some trade-offs and this is one of the trade-offs that the Dutch healthcare system has made. Knowing this, I've found it easier to get along with the system.  So I've found some ways to make the experience a bit easier:  Get your GP as involved as possible. If something doesn't feel right for a while, call your GP and ask them to help you. Even if they just prescribe Paracetamol for you, it'll be part of your medical record and would help you in the future.Let them know your previous medical history. This would help them to make a better decision in case you need medical help.Be as clear as possible about your symptoms and prepare enough details about your situation before calling your GP or the After Hours GP. This would help them to assess your situation better.If the issue persists, ask for a referral to a specialist. If your GP doesn't want to refer you to a specialist, you can change your GP.Sometimes you need to be persistent and follow up on your situation to get the help that you need.

I almost got fired for replacing a tensioner spring on a commercial printer. I was a computer operator in a tax processing data center, we had a several hundred page report due to the state dept of tax each morning with the results from the previous day processing that only printed to a single printer specified for that report. About an hour before the courier came to pick it up it hadn’t printed yet so I went to see why. Nothing seemed out of sorts so I looked at the printer closer to make sure there wasn’t a jam and noticed a spring had come loose so I just reset it and everything went smoothly. The next day I got called into a meeting after my shift (I worked third shift 12am-8am) with my boss, the vp for my region and the vp of Microsystems (dept in charge of printers) and I got literally yelled at for touching a Microsystems machine without authorization. The vp of Microsystems wanted me fired but when I explained that I called the on call and no one responded and that we would have missed the deliverable to the state if I hadn’t done what I did the regional jumped in to tell me if I did it again I would be fired but that for this one time they would let it slide. This is not a nice outcome because there are other parties in this context with their own set of needs and rules. For example, there are probably some regulations that require the company to have a certain level of control over their devices and only allows &quot;authorized&quot; personnel to touch them. This rule is in place because there has been a time when grass was greener and we used to trust each other but some parties took advantage of this trust and (probably illegally) profited from it. This, from one of this comment's replies, can also be another factor: You don’t even have the opportunity to break something under someone else’s warranty, thus not costing your company money specifically, and your legal department sends the government’s bill directly to the repair company under a failure to perform clause in the contract with them. The contract which likely says &quot;only our technicians are allowed to do anything mechanical to these machines not required for daily company operations&quot; Again, there was a simpler time where we had the time to take responsibility for our own devices, but when the scale of operations grew, it became more efficient to outsource the work and with that, comes the limitations of the lack of control over the devices. In larger scales, there's also the need to reduce destructive actions. This is a good thing that the printer was fixed in this case, but from the perspective of someone who doesn't know the people involved, allowing access to the device means anyone with any level of knowledge would be allowed to do so which is a huge risk for the party responsible for the device.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Personal Finance","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/personal-finance/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Useful Resources​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Personal Finance","url":"/personal-finance/#useful-resources","content":" Index Fund (European) Investor ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Phenomena","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/phenomena/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Table of Contents​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Phenomena","url":"/phenomena/#table-of-contents","content":"  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Wicked Problems","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/phenomena/wicked-problem/","content":"Wicked Problems A wicked problem, unlike a tame problem, is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.

You can read more about the differences between class methods and static methods in this StackOverflow answer. Dataclasses define classes that are used to store data. They are like structs in C.  note Check out Super considered super! talk by Raymond Hettinger for more information about classes.

Everything that's passed to the subroutine is stored in @_ array, and you need to manually check the number of arguments and their types. You can call subroutines without parenthesis. sub test { print $_[0] . &quot; &quot; . $_[1] . &quot;\\n&quot;; } test &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;; There's no proper way to define subroutine return types as well. See wantarray for more oh shit moments. Variables passed to the subroutine are passed by reference and if you modify values of the @_ array, original values would be modified as well. It's a good practice to always unpack @_: sub test1 { my $arg1 = $_[0]; } sub test2 { my $arg1 = shift; # Because it's Perl, and @_ would be the unannounced argument for shift and pop: https://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar#@_ } sub test3 { my ($arg1, $arg2) = @_; } You can expect a hash as the subroutine's input and create a hash from @_ on the subroutine. This approach has the benefit of copying the values, having named parameters, and being able to set default values for parameters. sub test { my %args = ( first_arg = &quot;default value&quot;, second_arg = undef, @_ # use @_ as a hash and overwrite the hash values if they exist on @_ ) } But this approach doesn't support references. test({ second_arg = &quot;world&quot; }); doesn't work because in this case $_[0] would be a hash reference, and would not be unpacked into the hash. To support this case, you need to dereference the hash reference: sub test { my %args = ( first_arg = &quot;default value&quot;, second_arg = undef, ref($_[0]) ? %{$_[0]} : @_ ) } But note that this approach is not perfect and is error prone. For example, test(first_arg=&gt;&quot;hello&quot;, { second_arg = &quot;world&quot; }); would not unpack second_arg because ref($_[0]) would be false and @_ would be used instead of dereferencing the hash reference. To keep it simple, just use @_ and unpack it. You can use the experimental signatures feature to define subroutine arguments. You can omit return &lt;something&gt;; and use &lt;something&gt; instead. sub test { return &quot;hello&quot;; } sub test2 { &quot;hello&quot; } You can omit $_ in some operators and functions to write shorter code: print for @array; grep { m/&lt;some regex&gt;/ } @array; This can also be used for bash one-liners: perl -ne 'print if m/&lt;some regex&gt;/' &lt;file&gt;   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"wantarray​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Oh Shit, Perl!","url":"/tech/oh-shit-x/perl/#wantarray","content":" wantarray depends on the context of the function call, meaning what you're doing with the return value of the function.
