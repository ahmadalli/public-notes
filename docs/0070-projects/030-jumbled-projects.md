# Jumbled Projects

Jumbled projects are me overcoming my obsession over creating the perfect groundwork and a strong base before building a project. That's why they're "jumbled".

I even bought a domain for these projects: [jumbled.dev](https://jumbled.dev).

## Projects

- [Calendar Builder](https://calendar-builder.jumbled.dev): I wanted to create and print a custom calendar for a friend. I built this (well, Gemini did most of the building) to create calendars with custom images and styles.
- [Nee Sticker](https://neesticker.jumbled.dev): Generate the Ja/Nee sticker for dutch postboxes to opt in or out of receiving unaddressed promotional mail and newsletters.
