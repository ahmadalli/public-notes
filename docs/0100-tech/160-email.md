## Personal Throwaway Email Addresses

For short term email addresses, I use `10 minute mail` services. I usually just search for it and use the first one that comes up.

For longer term email addresses, there are some privacy focused forward email services (that you can find using the same keyword). I bought a cheap domain to be used for this purpose. For email forwarding, here are some services that I know:

- CloudFlare Email Forwarding: ❌ -> Constantly failing to deliver emails due to IP blacklisting
- [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com/): ✅ -> Testing it now, works well so far
- [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/): ❔ -> Haven't tried it yet
