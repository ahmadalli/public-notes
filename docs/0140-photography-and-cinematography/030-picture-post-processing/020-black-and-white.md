# Black and White

Inspired from [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itw37I51LAg), I found these tips to be useful:

1. Start with a color image
1. Rise saturation of each color to separate colors from each other.
1. Convert to Black and White.
1. Adjust the luminance of each color to get the desired contrast.
