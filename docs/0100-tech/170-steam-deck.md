# Steam Deck

## Plugins

- [decky-loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader)

### Pause Games

[Pause Games](https://github.com/popsUlfr/SDH-PauseGames) gives you the ability to suspend the game, or you can configure it to suspend it when switching between games.

### CryoUtilities

[CryoUtilities](https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities) has some tuning options mostly for memory. I use it to tune the swap file size to 32GB to help with suspending games.
