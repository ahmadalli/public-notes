# Gaming on Casio Prizm

I had a Casio fx-CG50 calculator nearby for a short time and looked into the games that can be played on it:

- Game Boy Emulator: [<Icon icon="fa-brands fa-github" size="lg" /> tswilliamson/prizoop](https://github.com/tswilliamson/prizoop) emulates Game Boy games.
  - I found some Game Boy games on [emulatorgames.net](https://www.emulatorgames.net/roms/)
- There are other games on [cemetech.net](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/browse/prizm) but not all of them work. For example I couldn't get Flappy Bird to work, but I didn't try looked into it much.
